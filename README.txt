Search Algorithm and Missionary/Cannibal Problem

Cat Morgan, Jarrett Holtz, Oct. 1, 2014
Artificial Intelligence assignment , in LISP 
===============================================================================

The prompt for this assignment was to implement a general tree search algorithm,
implement the missionaries-and-cannibals domain, and use our search algorithm
to use breadth-first and depth-first search on the domain. 

We were given a Vaccuum World domain as an example, and we were tasked with 
writing the functions: cycle?, make-root-node, expand, and gen-search-guts

I wrote cycle?, make-root-node, expand, and gen-search-guts while my partner
wrote the missionaries-and-cannibals domain. We then code reviewed our work
together and discussed what we programmed and why. We also debugged the
program together.
